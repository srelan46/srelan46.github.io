# Projects

## Gomoku AI
_December 2023_
- **Description**: Developed a Gomoku-playing artificial intelligence, using a sophisticated six-layer sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ReLU activation function and a tailored heuristic minimax algorithm to enhance game state evaluation and move prediction.
- **Results**: Refined the AI's decision-making strategy and performance metrics, attaining approximately 84% prediction accuracy and consistently achieving a win rate exceeding 75% after training on a substantial dataset of past game plays.

## Evoke - AI-Based Journal and Meditation App
_June 2023_
- **Description**: Created an AI-powered audio journaling application capable of mood detection from voice recordings, integrating OpenAI and HumeAI technologies for sentiment analysis. The app recommends meditation practices based on the detected mood. Utilized Microsoft Azure for cloud deployment and service integration.
- **Functionality**: The application offers users a way to journal via audio recordings, analyzes the emotional content of the journal entries, and suggests meditation sessions accordingly.

## Ethereum Based Sports Betting App
_December 2022_
- **Description**: Launched an Ethereum blockchain-based sports betting application using Solidity for smart contracts and deployed it on the Goerli test network for validation.
- **Development**: Engineered the application's front-end using ReactJs and Material UI for a responsive user interface, and integrated it with the Ethereum blockchain through web3.js, enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of sports betting transactions.
