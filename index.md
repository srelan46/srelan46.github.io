- **Objective**: Focused on designing VNFs for the Diameter Signaling Router (DSR) product with the aim of streamlining the entire deployment process.
- **Outcome**: Successfully minimized deployment time by 20%, significantly boosting VNFM's efficiency.
- **Technologies Used**: Leveraged the versatility of **Java** and the cloud infrastructure capabilities of **OpenStack**. **Maven** was employed for project management, enhancing the development workflow.

#### Documentation and API Standardization
- Utilized **Swagger** for documenting RESTful APIs, ensuring clarity, standardization, and ease of use.
- Played a critical role in automating and enhancing lifecycle management through effective REST API interfaces.

#### Enhancing Testing and Deployment
- Improved automation testing scenarios for VNFM, crucial for assessing the reliability and efficiency of VNFs.
- Optimized Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in **GitLab**.
- Employed **Cucumber** for writing comprehensive unit test cases, facilitating a robust testing framework.

#### Cloud Deployment and Collaboration
